=== 🥞 dutch baby

- 1.5T butter
- dash salt
- 2 eggs
- 1/2c flour
- 1/2c milk
- optionally, frozen fruit (blueberries or strawberries are good)

Put butter and salt in 9"x9" pyrex pan in an oven preheating to
425degF. Mix the other ingredients very well while the oven is warming
up. Make sure to get a decent amount of air into the batter. This
seems to improve the rise, and there doesn't seem to be any risk of
overmixing, as I like a bready texture anyhow. Once the oven is
preheated, wait another minute or two. You want the butter to be fully
melted and maybe just a little bit browned. The pan and butter being
hot enough seems to keep the dutch baby from sticking to the pan when
it's done. Pour the batter into the pan and get it back into the oven
quickly so that not much heat is lost.

Bake 20m at 425degF.
